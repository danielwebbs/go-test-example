  The Feedback from this is the following:
      - number ns/op with ns being nano seconds and op being a run. The average time taken per a single execution
      - a decimal number before the ns/op value is the amount of times the test was executed
      - the last value is time taken, even for one second of testing, this might be two seconds as it takes go time to workout how many tests to benchmark
